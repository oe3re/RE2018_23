GUI calculator


Idea of this project is to demonstrate and calculate simple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and powering, in a clean and nice graphical interface. Operations are accessed by inputting the operands and signs that represent those operations (+,-,*,/,^). It is necessary to form buttons on which the numbers will be displayed and display to show the result depending on the input parameters.
